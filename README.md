# Kairos

Google Calendar notification daemon, written in Go using the Linux "Desktop Notification 
Specification" (`org.freedesktop.Notifications`). Kairos aims to provide a native calendar 
notification solution in a lightweight form. It's a standalone product that is not tied to a
particular desktop environment (or even window system, thankfully). That means it's perfect
for people who use window managers like i3, sway, xmonad, etc.
